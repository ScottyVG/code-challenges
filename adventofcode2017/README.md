# adventofcode2017
Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

### All Code is written in JavaScript with Node.js
Why JavaScript? Well I'm a web developer and it is something I'm super familiar with! Node.js is added so that I can access the filesystem and export modules for unit testing. 

### Run Tests in Mocha
`npm test`

### Run Program
`npm run santashelper`
